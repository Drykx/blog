Inspired by Andrej Karpathy’s blog and François Chollet’s ARC-AGI series, I've decided to start my own blog. Not because I presume my work will be as profound as theirs, but because their insights have helped me better grasp the core concepts and limitations of AI.

As I'll explore in future posts, the diversity of human perspectives is a crucial factor underpinning our collective intelligence. My hope is that by sharing my views on AI, I might reach at least one person who, in turn, could positively influence others.

*May this lone droplet find its mark,*  
*On unwithering gardens wide,*  
*Kindling forth the scarlet spark,*  
*In minds drawn by knowledge’s tide.*
